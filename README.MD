#AMOR

**AMOR** - a Multi-Ontology Reference library, is a complete library of helper functions for OWL ontologies with some remarkable features. 

+ Support for multiple OWL ontologies.
+ Ensures thread-safe ontology manipulations and queries.
+ Implements a wide range of functions: from simple "add an individual" to more esoteric "modify an SWRL rule".
+ Excellent performances which can be further customized based on user needs.
+ Ontology debug GUI available (currently working on OWL API 3, see branches).
+ Extensive and concentraded logging.
+ Out-of-the-box support for OWL reasoners. Easy to add more.
+ Based on latest standards: Java 8 and OWL API 5.

This is the ROS version of the library, ready to be included in your ROS projects. 

A ROS service for ontology manipulation and querying based on this library is available on EMAROLab@ARS ([**ARMOR**](https://github.com/EmaroLab/armor)).

For legacy support (Java 7 and OWL API 3.4.5) and more reasoner choices, use the [OWL-api3](https://github.com/EmaroLab/multi_ontology_reference/tree/OWL-api3) branch.

**master** and **OWL-api5** branches are OWL api 5 based and currently support only [*Openllet*](https://github.com/Galigator/openllet), an open source fork of the Pellet reasoner. More will be added as they are ported to OWL api 5.

Javadoc [documentation](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/EmaroLab/multi_ontology_reference/blob/master/files/doc/index.html) is now stored in this repository in the [/fles/doc](https://github.com/EmaroLab/multi_ontology_reference/tree/master/files/doc) folder, which contains also autogenerated UML diagrams : ([1](https://github.com/EmaroLab/multi_ontology_reference/blob/master/files/doc/%5Bintellij%5D%20UML%20diagrams/interface%20simplified.svg)) and ([2](https://github.com/EmaroLab/multi_ontology_reference/blob/master/files/doc/%5Bintellij%5D%20UML%20diagrams/interface%20expanded.svg)). Please see versioned owl api branches, for light or extended packages.

Check out the [/lib](https://github.com/EmaroLab/multi_ontology_reference/tree/master/amor/libs) folder for a complite jar of the library *amor-0.1.0.jar*. You will also find all the needed dependencig jars in the same folder.

Finally, see the [/examples](https://github.com/EmaroLab/multi_ontology_reference/tree/master/amor/src/main/java/it/emarolab/amor/examples) package for tutorials about the API. Note that unfortunatelly, the GUI is becoming unstable after the integration with OWL 5 as wel as other mijor utility of saving and loading the ontology.

**Benchmark Testing** - 
In [OWL-api5-Benchmarks](https://github.com/EmaroLab/multi_ontology_reference/tree/OWL-api5-Benchmarks) branch it's possible compare the execution time of 14 queries between aMOR and the OWL-APIs on 71 ontologies (you can find them in [/benchmark/LUBM-references/generated](https://github.com/EmaroLab/multi_ontology_reference/files/benchmarks/LUBM-references/generated)). To do that follow these steps:

+ if you want to see the queries open the queries.text file in [/benchmark/LUBM-references](https://github.com/EmaroLab/multi_ontology_reference/files/benchmarks/LUBM-references)
+ launch the Test.java file in the [/aMORanalysis](https://github.com/EmaroLab/multi_ontology_reference/amor/src/main/java/aMORanalysis)
+ a folder containing the results will be created in [/benchmark/LUBM-references](https://github.com/EmaroLab/multi_ontology_reference/files/benchmarks/LUBM-references)
+ this folder will contain results of all executed test, named with a timestamp
+ in each timestamp folder there are 71 folders, one for each tested ontology
+ in these folders you'll find a copy of the ontology file, two .csv file (one for aMOR and one for OWL-APIs) containing the results and a charts folder containing a plot of the mean of execution time for each query, a plot with the standard deviation of all queries and 14 plots each one containing the standard deviation of a single query
+ to create charts use the python scripts in [/files]((https://github.com/EmaroLab/multi_ontology_reference/files) folder

#

This specific **branch** contains utilities and examples for testing the change of performances over the standard [LUBM benchmark](http://swat.cse.lehigh.edu/projects/lubm/) of aMOR interface, with respect to purly OWL API 5.
