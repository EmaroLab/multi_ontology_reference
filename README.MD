#AMOR

**AMOR** - a Multi-Ontology Reference library, is a complete library of helper functions for OWL ontologies with some remarkable features. 

+ Support for multiple OWL ontologies.
+ Ensures thread-safe ontology manipulations and queries.
+ Implements a wide range of functions: from simple "add an individual" to more esoteric "modify an SWRL rule".
+ Excellent performances which can be further customized based on user needs.
+ Ontology debug GUI available (currently working on OWL API 3, see branches).
+ Extensive and concentraded logging.
+ Out-of-the-box support for OWL reasoners. Easy to add more.
+ Based on latest standards: Java 8 and OWL API 5.

This is the ROS version of the library, ready to be included in your ROS projects. 

A ROS service for ontology manipulation and querying based on this library is available on EMAROLab@ARS ([**ARMOR**](https://github.com/EmaroLab/armor)).

For legacy support (Java 7 and OWL API 3.4.5) and more reasoner choices, use the [OWL-api3](https://github.com/EmaroLab/multi_ontology_reference/tree/OWL-api3) branch.

**master** and **OWL-api5** branches are OWL api 5 based and currently support only [*Openllet*](https://github.com/Galigator/openllet), an open source fork of the Pellet reasoner. More will be added as they are ported to OWL api 5.

Javadoc [documentation](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/EmaroLab/multi_ontology_reference/blob/master/files/doc/index.html) is now stored in this repository in the [/fles/doc](https://github.com/EmaroLab/multi_ontology_reference/tree/master/files/doc) folder, which contains also autogenerated UML diagrams : ([1](https://github.com/EmaroLab/multi_ontology_reference/blob/master/files/doc/%5Bintellij%5D%20UML%20diagrams/interface%20simplified.svg)) and ([2](https://github.com/EmaroLab/multi_ontology_reference/blob/master/files/doc/%5Bintellij%5D%20UML%20diagrams/interface%20expanded.svg)). Please see versioned owl api branches, for light or extended packages.

Check out the [/lib](https://github.com/EmaroLab/multi_ontology_reference/tree/master/amor/libs) folder for a complite jar of the library *amor-0.1.0.jar*. You will also find all the needed dependencig jars in the same folder.

Finally, see the [/examples](https://github.com/EmaroLab/multi_ontology_reference/tree/master/amor/src/main/java/it/emarolab/amor/examples) package for tutorials about the API. Note that unfortunatelly, the GUI is becoming unstable after the integration with OWL 5 as wel as other mijor utility of saving and loading the ontology.

This specific **branch** contains utilities and example for testing the change of performances over the standard [LUBM benchmark](http://swat.cse.lehigh.edu/projects/lubm/) of aMOR interface, with resoect to purly OWL API 5.
