# AMOR

**AMOR** - a Multi-Ontology Reference library, is a complete library of helper functions for OWL ontologies with some remarkable features. 

+ Support for multiple OWL ontologies.
+ Ensures thread-safe ontology manipulations and queries.
+ Implements a wide range of functions: from simple "add an individual" to more esoteric "modify an SWRL rule".
+ Excellent performances which can be further customized based on user needs.
+ Ontology debug GUI available (currently working on OWL API 3, see branches).
+ Extensive and concentraded logging.
+ Out-of-the-box support for OWL reasoners. Easy to add more.
+ Based on latest standards: Java 8 and OWL API 5.

[DOWNLOAD .jar](https://github.com/EmaroLab/multi_ontology_reference/releases)

The jar file can be included in any project making use of ontologies, not necessarily ROS-based.
Nevertheless, if you are working under [ROS](http://www.ros.org/), we advice to clone the repository and build it as a ROS library project. If you are a ROS user, consider using ([**ARMOR**](https://github.com/EmaroLab/armor)), an ontology management service built on AMOR.
For standalone project AMOR can be used via Gradle.

**master** and **OWL-api5** branches are based on OWL-api 5 and Java 8. They currently support only [*Openllet*](https://github.com/Galigator/openllet), an open source fork of the Pellet reasoner. More will be added as more reasoners are ported to OWL api 5.

For legacy support (Java 7 and OWL API 3.4.5) and more reasoner choices, use the [OWL-api3](https://github.com/EmaroLab/multi_ontology_reference/tree/OWL-api3) branch.

Javadoc [documentation](http://emarolab.github.io/multi_ontology_reference/) is now stored in this repository in the [/docs](https://github.com/EmaroLab/multi_ontology_reference/tree/master/docs) folder, which contains also autogenerated UML diagrams : ([1](https://github.com/EmaroLab/multi_ontology_reference/blob/master/docs/%5Bintellij%5D%20UML%20diagrams/interface%20simplified.svg)) and ([2](https://github.com/EmaroLab/multi_ontology_reference/blob/master/docs/%5Bintellij%5D%20UML%20diagrams/interface%20expanded.svg)). Please see versioned owl api branches, for lightweight or extended packages.

Finally, see the [/examples](https://github.com/EmaroLab/multi_ontology_reference/tree/master/amor/src/main/java/it/emarolab/amor/examples) package for tutorials about the API. 

**NOTE:** the GUI and some minor utilities have become unstable after porting to OWL-api 5. We'll try to fix them as soon as we can.


## OWLapi5-Benchmarks

This specific **branch** contains utilities and examples to test AMOR performance with respect to simple owl-api. It is based on the [LUBM benchmark](http://swat.cse.lehigh.edu/projects/lubm/).
